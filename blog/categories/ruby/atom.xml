    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ruby on Mac OS Lion is going through a bit of a rough patch,
installation-wise. With Xcode 4.2, clang became the default compiler and gcc
was no longer included. Unfortunately, this has caused a lot of grief for
Rubyists on OS X, because for a while, MRI did not officially support
compiling with clang. With the release of 1.9.3-p125,
that situation has changed--clang is now officially supported--but
there are still some gotchas. This post details my toolchain and process for
running MRI 1.9.3 and 1.8.7 on Lion with Xcode 4.3.</p>

<p>If you want a TL;DR: install the Xcode 4.3 command line tools. Then,</p>

<p><code>
$ brew update
$ brew install autoconf automake
$ brew install https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-dupes/master/apple-gcc42.rb
$ rvm get head
$ rvm install 1.8.7
$ rvm install 1.9.3-head
</code></p>

<p>Read on for a detailed rationale.</p>

<h2>Xcode</h2>

<p>I use Xcode 4.3 and have installed the Xcode command line tools. I've
uninstalled all previous versions of Xcode. If you don't use Xcode itself,
save yourself a multi-gigabyte download and install just the command line
tools, which are now available
<a href="http://developer.apple.com/downloads">separately</a>. Thanks to Kenneth Reitz for
<a href="http://kennethreitz.com/xcode-gcc-and-homebrew.html">his work making this happen</a>.</p>

<h2>Homebrew</h2>

<p>Homebrew now has good support for Xcode 4.3. Just make sure to <code>brew update</code>.</p>

<p>In order to build MRI, you'll need to install some specific formulas. First
of all, autoconf and automake:</p>

<pre><code>$ brew install autoconf automake
</code></pre>

<p>You need these because Xcode 4.3 no longer includes autotools; if you have
installed Xcode 4.3 and uninstalled the previous versions,
you will no longer have <code>/usr/bin/autoconf</code>. You don't usually need the
autotools for installing homebrew formulas, since the downloaded packages
should come with <code>configure</code> pregenerated, but you do need them in order to
install head versions of MRI as described below.</p>

<p>Second, install gcc--the real version--from homebrew-dupes:</p>

<pre><code>$ brew install https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-dupes/master/apple-gcc42.rb
</code></pre>

<p>The command line tools provide <code>/usr/bin/gcc</code>, but it's a modified version
based on LLVM and if you try to use it to compile 1.8.7,
you'll get the following crash when trying to install gems:</p>

<p><code>
$ gem install bundler
/Users/john/.rvm/rubies/ruby-1.8.7-p358/lib/ruby/1.8/timeout.rb:60: [BUG] Segmentation fault
ruby 1.8.7 (2012-02-08 patchlevel 358) [i686-darwin11.3.0]
</code></p>

<p>Kenneth Reitz's
<a href="https://github.com/kennethreitz/osx-gcc-installer">osx-gcc-installer</a> is another
popular way of getting GCC,
but you don't want to install it on top of the Xcode 4.3 command line tools,
because it will overwrite working versions of llvm-gcc and clang.
Homebrew-alt's apple-gcc42 formula gives you <em>just</em> Apple's GCC 4.2,
installed at <code>/usr/local/bin/gcc-4.2</code>.</p>

<h2>RVM</h2>

<p>Install RVM and run <code>rvm get head</code>. The latest RVM
<a href="https://github.com/wayneeseguin/rvm/issues/763">has the smarts</a> to use the
correct compilers to build both 1.9.3 and 1.8.7 -- clang for 1.9.3 and gcc-4.2
for 1.8.7. I tend to install both so I can test my gems on both versions.</p>

<pre><code>rvm install 1.9.3
rvm install 1.8.7
</code></pre>

<p>You shouldn't see any errors or warnings from these commands,
and you shouldn't need to specify <code>--with-gcc=clang</code> or <code>--with-gcc=gcc-4.2</code>.
If you see something like <code>Building 'ruby-1.8.7-p358' using clang - but it's
not (fully) supported, expect errors</code>, you've done something wrong. Go back
and make sure your command line tools are correctly installed and you've
installed the apple-gcc42 homebrew-alt formula.</p>

<p>You should now have working copies of 1.9.3 and 1.8.7. Hooray!</p>

<p>Still, you might run into one more problem. If you try to debug on 1.9.3,
you'll get this error:</p>

<p><code>``

<p>This is caused by a <a href="https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/6080">clang incompatibility</a>
that didn't get fixed until after the 1.9.3-p125 release. Use the head
version of 1.9.3 instead: <code>rvm install 1.9.3-head</code>.</p>

<p>Phew! Now you're really bleeding edge.</p>

    <link href="http://jfirebaugh.github.com/blog/2011/01/21/making-sense-of-constant-lookup-in-ruby/"/>
    <updated>2011-01-21T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://jfirebaugh.github.com/blog/2011/01/21/making-sense-of-constant-lookup-in-ruby</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In Ruby 1.8, constant lookup is mostly <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_(programming)#Lexical_versus_dynamic_scoping">lexically scoped</a>,
even when using <tt>class_eval</tt> or <tt>instance_eval</tt>.
That is, constant lookup always searches the chain of <em>lexically
enclosing</em> classes or modules. The first lexically enclosing class or
module is not necessarily the same as <tt>self.class</tt>:</p>

<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/790454.js?file=constants.rb'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>puts &quot;#{RUBY_VERSION}-p#{RUBY_PATCHLEVEL}&quot;

X = '::X'

class Foo
  X = 'Foo::X'

  def foo
    puts &quot;instance method: #{X}&quot;
  end
end

Foo.new.foo

f = Foo.new
def f.bar
  puts &quot;singleton method: #{X}&quot;
end
f.bar

Foo.class_eval do
  puts &quot;class_eval: #{X}&quot;
end

Foo.new.instance_eval do
  puts &quot;instance_eval: #{X}&quot;
end
</code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>

<p>Here's the output on 1.8.7:</p>

<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/790510.js?file='></script>
<noscript><pre><code>1.8.7-p330
instance method: Foo::X
singleton method: ::X
class_eval: ::X
instance_eval: ::X</code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>

<p>Here we can see that within the lexical block defining <tt>Foo#foo</tt>, which
is enclosed by <tt>class Foo</tt>, <tt>X</tt> refers to <tt>Foo::X</tt>, while
in the lexical blocks used for the singleton method, <tt>class_eval</tt>, and
<tt>instance_eval</tt>, which are not in <tt>class Foo</tt>'s scope,
<tt>X</tt> refers to <tt>::X</tt>, the global constant.</p>

<p>However, in 1.9, the situation changes, and moreover, the behavior is
different between 1.9.1 and 1.9.2. Here's the result of running <tt><a
href="http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/set/ruby/">rvm 1.9.1,1.9.2
constants.rb</a></tt>:</p>

<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/790511.js?file='></script>
<noscript><pre><code>1.9.1-p378
instance method: Foo::X
singleton method: ::X
class_eval: Foo::X
instance_eval: Foo::X
1.9.2-p136
instance method: Foo::X
singleton method: Foo::X
class_eval: ::X
instance_eval: Foo::X</code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>

<p>So, in 1.9.1, constant lookup in <tt>class_eval</tt> and
<tt>instance_eval</tt> proceeds from the receiver, rather than the lexically
enclosing scope. Particularly for <tt>class_eval</tt>, this turned out to be a
<a href="http://www.ruby-forum.com/topic/191672">problematic</a> <a
href="http://www.ruby-forum.com/topic/199317">change</a>, breaking existing
libraries that depended on the 1.8.7 behavior and making it hard to build DSLs
that behaved in predictable ways. Eventually, it was decided to <a
href="http://www.ruby-forum.com/topic/199317#871425">revert to the 1.8
behavior</a>, and this was supposedly implemented:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
&gt; [Matz] would like to revert all of instance_eval, instance_exec,
&gt; class_eval, and class_exec to the behavior of 1.8 (including class
&gt; variables). [...]

I have just commited it to the SVN trunk.
</pre></blockquote>


<p>I say "supposedly" only because as you can see, the 1.9.2 behavior still
differs from 1.8.7 in the case of <tt>instance_eval</tt>. Was this an
oversight, or was the revert later unreverted for&nbsp;<span
style="font-family: monospace;">instance_eval</span>? If so, what was the
rationale? I searched the mailing list and subsequent commits, but couldn't
find an explanation. If anyone can shed light on the matter, I would
appreciate it.</p>

<p>As you can see, 1.9.2 also changed the behavior for singleton methods: the
receiver's scope is now searched before the lexically enclosing scope. This
change makes sense to me, and I haven't heard of it causing any problems.</p>

<p>Note that these rules apply to constant <em>definition</em>&nbsp;as well as
lookup. In 1.8 and 1.9.2, a constant defined in a class_evaluated block will
be defined in the enclosing lexical scope, rather than the scope of the
receiver. This is one of the things that makes <tt>Foo = Class.new { ...
}</tt> not <em>quite</em> the same as <tt>class Foo; ...; end</tt>:</p>

<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/790492.js?file='></script>
<noscript><pre><code>puts &quot;#{RUBY_VERSION}-p#{RUBY_PATCHLEVEL}&quot;

class Foo
  class Bar
  end
end

Baz = Class.new do
  class Quux
  end
end

puts Foo::Bar
puts Quux
</code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>

<p>The block passed to <tt>Class.new</tt> is effectively
<tt>class_eval</tt>uated, so in this example, the constant <tt>Quux</tt> ends
up defined at the top level. (And once again 1.9.1 is the exception: it
defines <tt>Baz::Quux</tt> instead.) This behavior can cause problems if you
are in the habit of defining test classes in RSpec <tt>describe</tt> blocks:</p>

<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/790496.js?file='></script>
<noscript><pre><code>require 'rspec'

describe &quot;a TestClass&quot; do
  class TestClass &lt; String
  end
end

describe &quot;other TestClass&quot; do
  class TestClass &lt; Integer
  end
end
</code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>

<p>Here <tt>TestClass</tt> winds up in the global scope, not the scope of the
RSpec example group that <tt>describe</tt> creates. If you have multiple specs
that define test classes with the same name, you may get collisions unless you
place each <tt>describe</tt> within a uniquely-named module or diligently
remove the constants in an <tt>after</tt> block. In the above example, you'll
get the error "superclass mismatch for class TestClass".</p>

<p>If you need to ensure a particular scoping is used (for example, if you need
to support 1.9.1 as well as 1.8.7/1.9.2), you can always be explicit about it
by prefixing constants with <tt>::</tt> (for global lookup), <tt>self::</tt>
(for receiver scope), or the fully qualified desired scope:</p>

<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/790500.js?file='></script>
<noscript><pre><code>require 'rspec'

describe &quot;a TestClass&quot; do
  class self::TestClass &lt; String
  end
end

describe &quot;other TestClass&quot; do
  class ::TestClass &lt; Integer
  end
end

module A
  module B
  end
end

describe &quot;third TestClass&quot; do
  class A::B::TestClass &lt; Integer
  end
end
</code></pre></noscript></div>

    <updated>2010-12-22T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://jfirebaugh.github.com/blog/2010/12/22/selenium-on-ruby</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The state of Selenium on Ruby is a bit confusing. Among the top google results for
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=selenium+ruby">"selenium ruby"</a> are several links that are badly out of date, and it's
not clear which of the many <a href="http://rubygems.org/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;query=selenium">gems</a> are ones you would want
to use. This post aims to clear up some of the confusion.</p>

<p>First of all, you should be aware that there are two Selenium APIs: the original 1.0 API, called Selenium-RC, and a
newer 2.0 API called Selenium WebDriver. Internally, the two have quite different architectures. In a nutshell,
Selenium-RC is based around a Java "Remote Control" server process that launches the browser under test and manages
communication between the client process (the Ruby interpreter, in our case) and the browser. The browser is controlled
by injecting the "Selenium Core" JavaScript framework into the Browser's built-in JavaScript interpreter. In contrast,
WebDriver requires no external process; the browser is launched directly, and controlled via means that vary from
browser to browser. For example, WebDriver controls Firefox via a custom Firefox extension.</p>

<p>Ruby has good support for both RC and WebDriver. The <a href="http://rubygems.org/gems/selenium-client">selenium-client</a> gem
(<a href="http://selenium-client.rubyforge.org/">docs</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ph7/selenium-client">source</a>) provides bindings for
the RC API, and the <a href="http://rubygems.org/gems/selenium-webdriver">selenium-webdriver</a> gem
(<a href="http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/RubyBindings">wiki</a>,
<a href="http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/docs/api/rb/index.html">docs</a>,
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/selenium/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Frb">source</a>) provides bindings for the WebDriver API.
You will likely want to use one of these two gems, but which one? If you are using Selenium via a higher-level Ruby
library such as Webrat or Capybara, the choice will be made for you: Webrat uses selenium-client, Capybara uses
selenium-webdriver. If you want to access a Selenium API directly, I would generally recommend selenium-webdriver.
The WebDriver API provides several advantages, including multi-browser testing, page navigation, drag-and-drop, and
multi-frame and multi-window support. It recently released its
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/selenium-users/browse_thread/thread/28ce2b37123a4e4d">first beta</a> and is where the
future of Selenium and Selenium on Ruby lies. It is, however, still beta software and sometimes changes its API in
aggravating ways. If stability is of paramount concern, stick with selenium-client.</p>

<p>You may find references to some other Selenium-related Ruby projects. The <a href="http://rubygems.org/gems/Selenium">Selenium</a>
gem (with a capital "S") and its associated website <a href="http://selenium.rubyforge.org/">selenium.rubyforge.org</a> paved the
way for Selenium on Ruby, but today it is obsolete, as is the <a href="http://rubygems.org/gems/selenium-rails">selenium-rails</a>
gem which depends on it. Unfortunately they are still prominently featured in search results and on the
<a href="http://seleniumhq.org/projects/ruby/">outdated "Selenium on Ruby" page</a>, which doesn't even mention selenium-webdriver.</p>

<p>The Selenium RC API relies on an external Java-based server process, and though the selenium-client gem provides rake
tasks to start and stop an RC server, it does not provide the actual jar file necessary to run the service. You can
either download and install it yourself, or install the <a href="http://rubygems.org/gems/selenium-rc">selenium-rc</a> gem, which
bundles it. You'll sometimes see a gem that depends on selenium-client also depending on selenium-rc solely for the jar,
as the <a href="https://github.com/pivotal/jasmine-gem">jasmine</a> gem does. The selenium-rc gem has some Ruby code in it too, but
it more or less duplicates functionality that's already part of selenium-client.</p>

<p>Finally there's the <a href="http://rubygems.org/gems/selenium">selenium</a> and
<a href="http://rubygems.org/gems/selenium_remote_control">selenium_remote_control</a> gems, which provide functionality similar
to selenium-client and selenium-rc. They don't seem widely used and at first glance I don't see any reason to prefer
them to the more popular gems. Recent releases of the selenium-webdriver gem include the selenium-client code as well,
and personally, I hope that selenium-webdriver can usurp the "selenium" gem name and become the One True Selenium gem
for Ruby.</p>
